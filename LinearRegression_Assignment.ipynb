        "### **Common Techniques for Transforming Categorical Variables in Regression Models:**  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **One-Hot Encoding (OHE)** – Converts each category into separate binary (0/1) columns.  \n",
        "   - Example: `Color = [Red, Blue, Green]` → `Red (1/0), Blue (1/0), Green (1/0)`  \n",
